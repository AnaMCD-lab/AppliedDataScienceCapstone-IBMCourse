    "The project will provide some places ideal for a restaurant, taking into consideration that the place is not already crowded with restaurants and that it is close enough to an area easily accessible. It will also give some  insight of what type of restaurants are already within an area to give options of what type of restaurants would be attractive for potential costumers. For example, if a place is not very crowded with restaurants and within the area there are no seafood restaurants, then a seafood restaurant would be a good option."
